## Features

- **Real-Time Multiplayer Gameplay:** Supports multiple players interacting simultaneously with smooth synchronization.
- **Innovative Game Mechanics:** Unique collision detection, player actions (move, punch, kick), and power-ups like boosts and hazards.
- **Robust Logging and Error Handling:** Comprehensive logging for monitoring and debugging, ensuring a stable gaming experience.
- **Extensible Design:** Modular codebase allowing easy addition of new features and game mechanics.

## Technologies Used

- **Java:** Core programming language for backend development.
- **WebSockets:** Enables real-time communication between the server and clients.
- **Jackson:** For JSON serialization and deserialization.
- **JUnit & Mockito:** Comprehensive testing frameworks for unit and integration tests.
- **Gradle:** Build automation tool managing dependencies and build processes.

## Architecture

AWSomeRoads follows a modular architecture comprising several key components:

- **GameServer:** The main server handling client connections, game state management, and communication.
- **GameEngine:** Core logic for updating game states based on player inputs and handling game mechanics like collisions and disqualifications.
- **Simulator:** Simulates game steps, updates positions of game objects, and interacts with the GameEngine.
- **Serializer:** Handles serialization of game states and messages using Jackson.
- **ClientHandler:** Manages individual client connections and message handling.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 17 or higher
- Gradle
- WebSocket-compatible client

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AWSomeRoads.git
   cd AWSomeRoads
   ```

2. **Build the Project:**

   ```sh
   ./gradlew build
   ```

3. **Run the Server:**

   ```sh
   ./gradlew run
   ```

## Testing

AWSomeRoads includes a suite of unit tests to ensure code reliability and maintainability. Tests are written using JUnit and Mockito, focusing on core functionalities like game mechanics, collision handling, and state updates.

### Running Tests
